# c-chat
This project is an end-to-end chat system written in C that demonstrates how to build reliable communication over sockets. It implements both the client and server sides of a messaging system, handling connection setup, message transmission, and state management. The goal of this project is to explore the fundamentals of network programming in C.

# setup
1.) install raylib (graphics library I used)
2.) install raygui.h and put it in the include directory (can be found here https://github.com/raysan5/raygui)

# build
1.) create a build folder in the root of the project
2.) run the build.sh script to build the inital binary
3.) if you change the code you can run rebuild.sh 
4.) use run.sh to run the binary
